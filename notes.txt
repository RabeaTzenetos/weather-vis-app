**Future To-Dos**

Deployment:
[] Amend .github/workflow/deployment.yml to only be triggered when changes were made to relevant files / ignore changes to other files

Lambda/S3:
[] Save down latest [3] forecast.csv files in S3, e.g. overwrite and rotate forecast-latest.csv, forecast-H1.csv, forecast-H2.csv

App Functionality:
[] Prevent graph shifts based on min/max of cities not shown. Idea: calculate min/max based on cities selected (callback)
[] Show latest [3] forecasts in plotly, make older forecasts more opaque
